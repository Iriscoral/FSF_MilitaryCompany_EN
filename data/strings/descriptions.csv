To mitigate the long-term damage to the hull structure caused by its massive recoil, and to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy, a compensator for attitude control must be turned on to provide additional angular torque and to allow the engines to recoil before firing. The other problem is that rocket-extended munitions can be intercepted just as well as torpedoes.

aEP_cap_duiliu,SHIP,"The ship, which only recently appeared in the Sector, is a symbol of the FSF Corporation's growing power and as such a new face compared to the many experienced designs in the field. For the longest time, the main ship used by the Company was the Javelin-Class, designed in the days of the Domain of Man, but since becoming a force in the Sector FSF needed a warship designed for itself, thus spurring the development of the Thermocline-Class. Neither heavily armoured nor fast; but with its large number of densely packed weapon slots, if you can seize the moment, a skilled captain can destroy the opponent with a moment's projection of power. This battleship thus represents the FSF against their rivals within the Sector.

The Thermocline symbolizes drastic changes in a short period of time, and its design without large slots makes it seem weaker in a conventional drawn-out gun battle, but in the hands of a brave captain, it can win battles without engaging in lengthy exchanges, and it is those who are convinced they will win in a narrow encounter that will gain the favor of the goddess of victory.

",,,,
aEP_cap_nuanchi,SHIP,"Seemingly looking like an asteroid factory with engines and armor bolted onto it, the Warmpool-Class certainly fits the missile mainship designation. The cost of scaling up a miniature missile factory to full size is great; not only is the space redundancy for extended launcher modifications squeezed dry, but the frequency of missile launches suffers as well. But with increased time in the field, the full-size missile factory's steady stream of missile regeneration can make it prove its worth. Unlike its cluttered appearance, the Warmpool-Class takes full account of the need for impact mitigation and damage control in its hull structure and stores its munitions evenly, giving it not only good armor but also a near zero chance of sudden detonation in the event of damage.

The haphazard layout of the Warmpool-Class was also designed to accommodate the ""Reflash"" shipsystem, a loading system that uses standardized feeding modules to quickly feed ammunition from all parts of the ship to the missile launchers. This system supports continuous use when sufficient energy is available, allowing the Warmpool class to produce a terrific amount of launches in a short period of time. When the Warmpool class was officially commisioned, the mainstream view was that it was a bold expansion of the Gryphon-Class. Such a missile ship is a feared existence at all times, though it may not necessarily show the firepower that matches the designed number of missile slots. Then again, perhaps, the people who have seen such a display of firepower no longer exist.",,,,
aEP_cap_biaobing,SHIP,"If the Paragon is the product of a mixture of the delusions of the senior admirals and the ambitions of the top brass of Tri-Tachyon, the Javelin-Class is a solid step towards the energization of battleships. Unlike the Paragon-Class, which uses an advanced targeting core, the Javelin-Class uses a separate firing support radar designed to address the lack of range in most energy weapons. In order to bear the strain of this system, the Javelin-Class sacrificed much of its armor as a battleship in exchange for excellent, if not superior maneuverability, which, combined with the luxurious weapon slot configuration throughout the body, can provide terrifying pressure on the enemy in a single short burst.

Despite the huge sacrifices made, the Javelin class substantially cannot afford to keep its radar on at full power for long periods of time, which means that in a one-on-one encounter, most conventional live-fire battleships can easily suppress the Javelin class if they can maintain a superior range. The Javelin class is more like a return to the old days of traditional battleships, simple and practical, than the energy battleships that use advanced targeting cores that require a lot of highly skilled personnel to maintain. The Javelin should not have appeared in the Persean Sector, because neither the previously stationed battlegroup nor the XIV Battlegroup that were intended for rotation were equipped with them, but the ship still appeared in the FSF Corporation's cargo list in an enigmatic way. Excluding the various additional rumors, one thing is certain - that the founding fathers of the FSF Corporation must have had close ties with certain executives before the Collapse to be able to get prototypes of various equipment under test.
",,,,
aEP_cap_neibo,SHIP,"A battlecruiser built to hunt smaller ships, unlike most of the company's fleet which have slower characteristics and a focus on heavy firepower. The Internalwave employs a pulse burst propulsion system previously deployed on strikecraft capable of propelling its giant bulk in an instant. Another unique design is the turret module attached to the main gun, which has independent weapon and flux management systems, greatly reducing the pressure on the mothership's flux management. Although classified as a battlecruiser, its armor and structure are slightly higher than the company's battleships, making the Internalwave a slightly awkward design. As an alternative design of line ship, a large number of small slots are not conducive to taking damage, and it is easy to fall into a 'no guns available' scenario in an evenly matched battle, while on the other hand, the huge damage output of the main gun makes it extremely dangerous towards small and medium-sized ships, which puts the captain's skill at target piroritzation to the test. In order to mitigate the effects of damage to the weapon slots, modular armor has been arranged on the bow, a move that increases frontal facing damage resistance to a limited extent, but once this armor is disengaged, it is recommended that the Internalwave avoid combat with any warships of the same hull size.",,,,
aEP_cap_decomposer,SHIP,"One of FSF's newest ship developments following the Collapse, the Decomposer-Class carries a significant amount of fuel and supplies, along with an open deck dismantling system. It was designed to serve the supply needs of long-range fleets by dismantling the surviving wreckage of ships on the battlefield to recover needed parts and various consumables. For fleets with less than stellar logistical systems, having this type of ship greatly reduces the pressure on logistics and allows an elite fleet to sustain itself for a considerable period of time in the event of a supply failure.

When a ship is shut down in battle, if the hull does not break apart on the spot, a significant part of its interior can be recovered. Normally, it is not until the battle is won or lost that one side is given the authority to clean up the battlefield, by which time many of the items in the wreckage that need to be kept airtight have drifted out into space in a fragmented manner and cannot be recovered. The Decomposer-class, which can conduct its salvage operations even on the battlefield, has a large exposed operations deck with a hole in the middle leading to the inner deck, where its supporting drones have built-in disintegration beams that can precisely break the wreckage into appropriately sized pieces to be carried back to the operations deck for recovery of usable items. To cater for undisturbed operations, the Decomposer has enough firepower to repel smaller ships, making it a jack-of-all-trades sufficient to form the core of a small fleet.
Although the armour and structure are of military grade material, the Decomposer sacrifices the space of the shield generator in favour of an on-board fleet of shield drones to protect against damage to meet the power demands of both cargo and disassembly operations.

",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu,SHIP,"A heavily armored freighter only considered when the most dangerous routes are involved, the Upstream-Class, equipped with battleship-grade armor and structural design, is able to ignore most threats in the Sector. As the star of the special transport industry, it should never be treated as a mere cargo ship, especially considering its support systems, which can deploy additional armor to withstand massive damage until reinforcements arrive.

Relative to its supply needs, the maintenance of this folding armor requires more effort than imagined. But in consideration against the threat profiles of the most turbulent areas of the sector, its not that big of a deal.",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu_mk3,SHIP,"This modified Upstream-Class, the work of retired FSF designers, removes the telescopic external armor and adds a series of gun galleries and auxiliary engines in the area of the original cargo hold.

The Upstream-Class has rarely been the target of pirate attacks, much less a successful victim, with only a few documented losses since its inception, thus there is some untold story behind the appearance of this ship. Apparently, someone took a Upstream and found a retired designer to build this large iron block that was as close to an official modification as a third-part design could be. ",,,,
aEP_cap_shangshengliu_mk2,SHIP,"A modification based on the Upstream-Ckass for transporting antimatter fuel. Statistically, in the business field of special fuel transport, the risk reduction from minimizing exposure to high-risk areas is far better than a slapping on a few more layers of armor, but the MK.III chose to do both. It is supported by a giant engine made up of multiple large engines connected in parallel, exceeding any conventional option in size and fuel consumption. After a long acceleration phase, it can traverse the battlefield at speeds that destroyers can't even hope to match.

The fuel needed to operate this monster engine comes directly from the cargo of the MK.III, making its actual effective capacity lower than the marked value. Although it may have consumed half of its cargo while crossing dangerous area, its arrival with what cargo remains would be considered a success by most operators.",,,,
,,,,,,
aEP_cru_hailiang,SHIP,"This cruiser, built similar to fire support platforms found on space stations, is designed as a sort of suppression warship. In order to complete the suppression of a large number of small ships, the Seaweight-Class has large slots in each direction to provide range and firepower needed, and thus does not encounter the problem of facing multiple enemies in different directions with a single turret.  In the suppression mission, the relatively unimportant aspect of maneuverability and frontal capability is sacrificed. Few forces in the Sector have ordered this kind of warship, mainly because they generally have their own warships for these sort of specialist tasks, but a few marginal independent planets have ordered a small number of these to counter the use of high-speed ships for raids by small pirate groups.
",,,,
aEP_cru_zhongliu,SHIP,"The mainstay of the FSF fleet, the Midstream-Class was designed as a conventional cruiser made to make the best out of the company's strengths. Only slightly more protected than a typical light cruiser, the Midstream lacks the all-important manoeuvrability, which typcially makes it such an easy target to destroy, but when built up to a certain size and sharing possible damage pressure with other ships, a squadron of Midstreams can quickly destroy any ship within a wide angle with overlapping slots.

The Midstream-Class's powerful large slot design combined with its extra range gives it a level of gunnery capability found on mainline vessels, and protecting their vulnerability is the key to victory in a battle. The Midstream was one of the later designs to enter service in the FSF's fleet and as such represents the maturing of the Company's homemade designs.",,,,
aEP_cru_requan,SHIP,"A light missile ship based on the hull of the Sidestrike class, it retains its built-in missile factories as a lighter version of the Warmpool class. Designed with a focus on ease of production, the Hot Spring class has only a limited number of slots for self-defence weapons, meaning that it can easily be taken out by any ship - even a frigate - that rushes into its vicinity. But even with its many drawbacks, its low deployment cost is reason enough for fleet commanders to favour it.",,,,
aEP_cru_pingding,SHIP,"The Pacifiers are not commonly found in the FSF's fleet, as their over-specialised design often only allows them to be used when besieging the most difficult targets. That said, a particular advantage of the Pacifer-class are the rocket-extended weapons mounted on them, capable of  destroying enemies beyond the lock-on range of most ships' fire control systems. Although these ships have not been used in anger since the first Pacifiers appeared on a mission to destroy a pirate colony, these gamechangers will always be taken into account by the Company's enemies.

",,,,
aEP_cru_shanhu,SHIP,"Developed as part of the enhancement of the company's fleet aviation capabilities, the Stony Coral's was initally much superior in maximum speed and deployment consumption. However, in subsequent discussions and after constant additions, it was developed less as a pure strikecraft carrier, but more as a support platform with both missile and shield drone systems integrated into it.",,,,
aEP_cru_pubu,SHIP,"A type of siege carrier that uses high-powered drive system launchers to catapult fighters to long distances. Using complex mechanical movement components to protect the proper functioning of the central rail system, the Waterfall class demands the highest level of captainship. Whether it is the fragile ejection rails or the sophisticated linkage structure, the slightest failure in maintenance can lead to it being taken offline. Its positioning as an offensive carrier belies its difficulty in operating in a battlefield environment, and members who follow their training to the letter from far enough away often find it hard to imagine just how serious a disaster they have caused at a distance.



The prototype of the Waterfall-Class, the first choice of the highly talented, it traces its origins to a replica of the wreckage of a carrier that was abandoned because it was too badly damaged, and reverse-engineering has uncovered what is thought to be a steam ejection barrel track and boiler mechanism, with a large number of suspected forge structures remaining. The radiation and high temperature environment has severely damaged the hull of the wreck and everything that is known about it is speculative and may even be a complete deviation from the original design intent. The only information that can be confirmed is the word ""Teikaku"" written on the bulkhead.

",,,,
,,,,,,
aEP_des_shendu,SHIP,"This design is too extreme for a guided missile destroyer, and it is a bit of a stretch to believe only fit both a large missile slot and an flight deck into a hull the size of a light cruiser, leaving the Deeplayer-Class with no room for weapons beyond a few point defence slots. The most controversial aspect of the ship is that the massive hull is equipped with only destroyer-class subsystems, while having huge spaces in hull not used upgrading to light cruiser-class, instead being fitted with a set of fully automatic minelayers independent of the ship's aviation console. This completely separate module was particularly odd for a mothership that already had an air control system and fighter production line, but at least its excellent effectiveness in anti-harassment ensures that this ship was not replacable.

",,,,
aEP_des_shendu_mk2,SHIP,"A prototype ship of sorts, a light cruiser designed to transport and launch strategic cruise missiles, carrying only the necessary point defence slots to counter dangerous environments - which explains why such a large hull was equipped with only destroyer-class subsystems, as it was originally intended as a missile carrier.",,,,
aEP_des_yangji,SHIP,"A warship stuffed with guns on both sides and a classic FSF export model, it has a good balance of firepower and manoeuvrability, with a built in AA system giving it an additional layer of survivability. As an export model, universality is the first design criterion, and the simple maintenance requirements and slightly larger tonnage than a normal destroyer make it exceptionally popular in the fringes of the Sector. Excellent in single-ship and skirmish situations, but the relatively standard subsystems limits its overall potential.",,,,
aEP_des_lianliu,SHIP,"The company's general purpose high-speed destroyer, with three mounted turrets on the centre line, provides this warship with a wide range of firepower options. Not only that, but the ship's level of protection has not been sacrificed too much, making it suitable for a wide range of cruising missions, allowing it to always be on the front line of the Company's conflicts, and making it a staple export model. Despite the limited flux dissipation, its tactical system allows for a good amount of firepower at short notice by dropping shields.",,,,
aEP_des_cengliu,SHIP,"A heavy destroyer meant to provide fire support. Fitting the weapon re-invigoration system to medium to large ships is a difficult process, as the larger the ship is the more pressure it puts on the buffer zone, thus requiring a significant portion of the core hull to be reinforced with bulkheads. This was all to boost the limited firepower; as such deploying a destroyer of this type requires a fairly strict adherence to certain tactical regulations, rending it useless in untrained hands.",,,,
aEP_des_youjiyan,SHIP,"The Organic Salt series represents the Company's excellent armoured freighter/tanker options, fitted with armour that would make most destroyers blush, and a flight deck to deal with high speed threats. The biggest major downside is taht maintaining and deploying it is no less expensive than doing so for a proper military destroyer. There is never a shortage of people willing to put a premium on their cargo in the Sector, but in this era passive defence can only a delaying tactic, thus its real value lies in being able to eliminate 'accidents'. Any attempted piracy will have little effect on it unless it can defeat an entire escort fleet head on.",,,,

aEP_fga_wanliu,SHIP,"Only found on large battlefields, this frigate integrates a powerful line targeting system and large slots to flank the main ships when they are caught in a tangle with each other. Even if the enemy decides to focus their fire on it in priority, it is equipped with a degraded version of a Fortress Shield to provide some survivability. Usually manned by older, rotating officers from the main ships as captain and gunner, successfuly piloting of this frigate requires more thoughtful thinking rather than hot blooded action.",,,,
aEP_fga_yonglang,SHIP,"A medium to large frigate carrying two heavy anti-shield gun-fired torpedoes. When multiple escorts were operating in concert with larger warships, there was often a problem of blocking each other's lines of fire and manoeuvring lines, resulting in the loss of the frigate. After repeated validation the development department decided to create specialist coordinated attack frigates with built-in gun-launched torpedoes using a principle similar to that of a door-breaking cone, capable of knocking out the target's shields in a flash, but also temporarily incapacitating themselves after firing - not only because of the weapon's huge flux output, but also in the physical sense that the recoil will push themselves away.


",,,,
aEP_fga_xiliu,SHIP,"A frigate designed according to a rather old layout. The four-way slot is more of a deterrent than anything else, it is the most conventional of the FSF frigates, although it lacks all the striking features that make the Lasher-Class famous for its cheap firepower through its quantity of weapons. By streamlining the number of weapons to improve quality, the captain's piloting skills are made more demanding while also significantly raising the ship's performance ceiling.",,,,
aEP_fga_xiliu_mk2,SHIP,"The Finestream class has been substantially rebuilt, with a large number of slots removed or modified, and is now a competent raider with a dangerous torpedo-firing capability, greater manoeuvrability and a small number of cargo holds fitted to carry her master's 'loot'.",,,,
aEP_fga_raoliu,SHIP,"Designed as a scout, the frigate is known for its low price and survival rate that does not match its price. The Recoil class is a frigate that combines high speed with a damping shell, with most of the spaces on the hull suitable for weapons being taken up by armour and damping equipment, making its slot utilisation awkward and its lack of firepower and over-protection making it one of the least popular frigates for pirates in the star realm. For this reason, despite being positioned as a military ship, it has far more orders for civilian and training use.

aEP_b_l_aa40,WEAPON,"Originally designed as a planetary defence weapon, it was fitted to warships after its flat-firing potential was discovered. The kinetic energy of the fragmentation created by an anti-air projectile of this calibre is sufficient to suppress the shields, but the continuous firing of large calibre ammunition places severe demands on the strength and precision of the material. Only a few ships in the galaxy can afford to expend such a fearsome weapon, and it is often used against phenomena that cannot be explained by classical physics.",,,,

aEP_breakin_hammer,WEAPON,"A brutal anti-shield torpedo that inflicts massive kinetic damage, the Breaching Torpedo is the embodiment of FSF's technological capabilities, as the principles behind its operation are quite complex. The warhead contains a set of gravitational field generators that alters the payload's own weight so that the warhead contains far more kinetic energy than its weight, though these sophisticated instruments are sacrificed upon impact.
The torpedo uses a physics-defying gravitational field generator, whose mass in normal conditions can be accelerated to sufficient speed using conventional propulsion systems, and after gaining sufficient velocity the gravitational field activates. This allows a longer range than a normal torpedo, while the kinetic energy impact on a successful hit on the enemy shield would be fatal. Note that its effect is immediately lost in the event of damage to internal parts caused by a rigid impact on the casing. What remains is an impact exceeding some of its counterparts.

aEP_as_bay,WEAPON,"A heavy anti-ship missile, designed to directly impact its target before detonating the charge, ideally firing a hot jet forward into its any breach caused by sheer kinetic damage. It is particularly devastating if it can overload the shields in its impact, as its secondary payload will not be absorbed by the shields and continue to damage the ship.",,,,
aEP_as_large,WEAPON,"A terrifyingly high yield anti-ship missile for the total destruction of enemy capital ships. Works on the same principle as its medium-sized version, although the bulkier hull limits its speed and steering capability.",,,,
aEP_m_m_fluxtube,WEAPON,"This auxilliary equipment is another example of how development may end up recycling old ideas; ships that have long since left the era of needing their own heat sink have ended up utilizing this means of direct discharge through a material carrier in order to obtain better flux dispersion. Each flux tube is a simplified version of the ship's flux systems, with space previously used for the missile magazine, targeting and other systems has been modified to channel flux from the hull. This mechanism requires a period of preparation before launch.",,,,
aEP_m_s_harpoon,WEAPON,"A high speed kinetic medium to long range support missile. By attacking enemy shields to reduce the pressure on frontline warships, the high quality warhead ensures that even if it hits the hull, it will do some damage.",,,,
aEP_m_l_harpoon,WEAPON,"A heavy-lined anti-shield missile with a large hull and a large thrust engine, capable of impacting targets at high quality velocities and posing a threat to even moderate armour. Launched at high muzzle velocity and accelerated throughout, it is mounted on the side of the ship and can arc around the frontal point of the target's defences.",,,,

aEP_railway_gun,WEAPON,"One of the largest calibre weapons in the Sector to be mounted in a standard shipborne weapon mount, the Gustav, a prototype of the Company's Advanced Weapons Program, has the distinct utility of being compatible with both energy and ballistic slots. 

-- ""It penetrated the detector shield in the first destructive test, destroying the generator and flux pressure detector behind, so we... temporarily have no data available.""",-FSF先进武器计划科研员的定期汇报,,,
aEP_b_m_lighting,WEAPON,"The placement of a high-density miniature battery in the warhead takes away some of the penetrating power of the shell, but allows it to emit a destabilising effect on the impacted shield. By pumping energy into the shield after contact, it thus causes numerous fluctations throughout its generated surface, significantly increasing the difficulty of maintaining it.

aEP_ftr_ut_repair,SHIP,"A small repair platform was developed in response to battlefield demand for the slow repair of friendly ship armour in emergencies, though battlefield use means its unable to repair more than 50 per cent of armored sections and frigates.",,,,
aEP_ftr_ut_supply,SHIP,"Logistics helicopters, also known as battlefield followers, are able to suck up the flux of friendly forces and transfer it to themselves. These space-atmosphere hybrid twin-propeller aerospace craft are mostly used to transport marines or supplies to and from the planet's surface, and are equipped with a high-speed takeoff propulsion system to break gravity for this purpose. When used in space combat, the space inside is converted to a large flux capacitors, but unfortunately these logistic craft cannot dissipate this flux and have to carry it away.

aEP_ftr_icp_gunship,SHIP,"The ultimate in interceptor design, with a large number of machine gun turrets with a wide field of fire, using EMP rounds to paralyse the opponent before the main beam cannon in the middle deals a devastating blow. This unforgiving design against fighters has earned its reputation among pilots. Although the lack of sustained armour-breaking capability and low speed dictate that it is very awkward for anti-ship attacks.",,,,
aEP_ftr_bom_attacker,SHIP,"A heavy attack aircraft, its light frame gives it excellent manoeuvrability and it uses warship-level weaponry to attack its targets. Although the total damage is considerable, it takes a long time to dump its ammunition and its relatively unarmoured hull limits its effectiveness.	",,,,
aEP_ftr_bom_nuke,SHIP,"This strategic bomber with its heavy armour and tail gun carries an unguided nuclear bomb, at the cost of its slow and sluggish flight. Despite its many shortcomings, the nuclear bomb's unstoppable power makes it the FSF's best option for destroying stationary targets.",,,,

aEP_ftr_sup_tank,SHIP,"The prototype was a single prototype from a Domain-era drone shield test program that failed to dispose of the equipment, with advanced built-in flux shunting equipment to convert the pressure from the aircraft shield to the mothership, and was reverse engineered by the FSF and installed on a Dark Side class frigate. A support missile launch system was added to the prototype to provide a little fire support.",,,,
aEP_ftr_sup_guardian,SHIP,"A close range interceptor drone that allows high top speed and manoeuvrability to drive off small enemy ships without requiring a combat radius. It has a built-in burst propulsion system and a temporary shield generator that allows it to deflect critical projectiles for nearby friendly ships at high speeds in times of emergency. Its performance could have been even better if it had not been subject to the restricted computing cores required by the laws of the Domain, enforced by the Hegemony.

aEP_ftr_ftr_hvfighter,SHIP,"A heavy fighter carrying a pair of large calibre cannons with enough destructive power to rip through destroyer class hulls and also capable of burst propulsion through tactical systems to avoid point defence fire, but poor manoeuvrability puts it at a disadvantage in a battle between fighters and is usually only deployed on battlefields where strikecraft supremacy has been gained.",,,,
aEP_ftr_ftr_helicop,SHIP,"A heavy helicopter gunship that can operate in the atmosphere, but also in space. Carrying multiple Firing Pin Rocket Pods, it can pave the way for other carrier aircraft to attack.

aEP_FSF,FACTION,"Fast, Safe, Functional aka FSF Corporation is a military corporation founded after the Collapse to sell arms and OEM ships. Its founding dates back to a pre-Collapse powerful smuggling ring, with ties to many of the equipment testing units of the Domain of Man, selling prototypes to various corporations at high prices. With the failure of the Gates, the upper echelons of the syndicate were trapped in a secret warehouse in Perseus. Knowing that the power at their disposal was far from sufficient to protect the precious cargo in the warehouse, they relied on the mountains of supplies in the warehouse to completely disappear from the Starfield dispute and set up the FSF predecessor as an underground organisation.

For quite some time, taking advantage of the chaos at the beginning of the Collapse, they secretly drew Perseus' shocked scientists into the organisation in order to be able to produce copies of the most advanced batch of prototype ships in the FSF's hands at the time, but nothing more was heard of them until the First AI War.

In the golden age after the First AI War, the sporadic appearance of foreign trade warships that people had never seen before in the defence of the Edge World colonies symbolised the FSF's emergence on the Perseus scene as the giant corporation known today for providing, among other things, shipbuilding, military instruction, and weapons trade. Although they have always been a mega-corporation following the laws of the Hegemony throughout the Sector, in recent years their fleet numbers have risen steeply to show their ambition.",,,,
aEP_FSF_Relay,CUSTOM,"The location of this communications repeater is very unusual, and the model is not a common Sector standard model, but instead it's power and clarity of the repeater suggest that it must be a Domain artifact. The FSF must have dragged it from elsewhere (or from its own depot) and fixed it in planetary orbit.",,,,
aEP_FSF_SaleStation,CUSTOM,This is the external business centre of FSF Corporation and the orbital facility where FSF was first established. It was chosen in a resource-poor and empty system and has grown over the years to become a commercial hub for people and an armed interstellar fortress.,,,,
aEP_FSF_DefStation,CUSTOM,"The FSF's newly constructed military base in the centre of the system, its presence symbolises a change in corporate policy. Although the FSF had been strong enough to defend itself many years ago, it did not maintain a larger military. The completion of this military base signifies the completion of its transformation into a militarised organisation.",,,,
aEP_FSF_Homestar,PLANET,"A brown dwarf whose faint nature makes observation difficult. Apart from this, perhaps the only way to describe this system is impoverished, with a lack of exploitable planets and not even an asteroid belt.",,,,
aEP_FSF_Homeplanet,PLANET,"If the planet had been closer to its star it would have been a planet with a habitable temperature, but unfortunately now it is a barren place with long days and nights, permanently covered in ice and snow, where even fully dressed protective equipment would not allow one to stay for too long, and it would be rather unwise to set up a permanent settlement when it would consume so many resources. Its most striking features are the huge facilities on the surface and the grand entrance. It is not known whether the company's facilities planetside was built before or after the Collapse, given that it did not exist before the First AI War, but what is confirmed is that it existed before the First AI War and was gradually abandoned afterwards, with its main function shifting to an orbital space station. Perhaps the planet's harsh climate had become an increasingly serious problem as the company's operations expanded.",,,,
aEP_FSF_Companyplanet,PLANET,"A typically barren planet, with minerals of some value, but also so close to the star that it is extremely expensive to mine, around which the FSF Corporation has built a new military base, as a fully functional fortress that can withstand stellar radiation for long periods of time is indeed a difficult target on a battlefield close to the star, which perhaps explains why the FSF is willing to spend huge amounts of money here.",,,,
aEP_IND_Homestar,PLANET,"The red dwarf does not emit enough heat to support any of the planets at the right temperature, and the cold grips the system. The dimness of light makes any work in this system difficult, and poses a tricky piracy problem.",,,,
aEP_IND_Homeplanet,PLANET,"The only way the names of most of the fringe colonies are known today is on a sign at some technological dig site. In an age of chaos when the sector was in a tizzy over resources, most of these untouched places were dead in ten or twenty years.

The temperature on Lamdor X was constantly below the working limit of most equipment, and within two to three years of losing its energy supply most of the population had been lost, except for the city where the spaceport was located, which survived on an antimatter furnace capable of operating for centuries - and on what was left of other lifeless gatherings - until connections with the rest of the sector were re-established.

In light of the previous tragedies on the planet, ""distant relatives are better than close neighbours"" became the principle of diplomacy for most of the local governments, and a very deep defence partnership with the FSF was established from early on, with personnel and equipment exchanged very frequently indeed, despite the insistence of each side on the independence of the other.",,,,

aEP_IND_Piratestation,CUSTOM,"Given the distance between Lamdor X and the Core, it was a very lucrative livelihood to raid shipping fleets. Nominally a waystation, but in reality the pirates control it to listen in on shipping fleets - or to bring the spoils of war to enjoy life here.",,,,
aEP_FSF_Earthstar,PLANET,"Once a testament to the conquest of known space by the Domain of Man, the DWR43 system was planned to be renamed after a great terraforming, relying on various stellar energy extraction stations that would allow it to become one of the beating hearts of interstellar industry. Now this blue giant shines with nothing but unfinished facilities and lifeless planets.",,,,
aEP_FSF_Stationplanet,PLANET,"Once, a small mining colony existed on this planet, protected by a stellar shroud and remaining so after further plans for transformation were aborted with the Great Collapse. Despite the unbearably high temperatures, at least the ecologically modified soil could still grow some modified crops, and with enough time the people trapped here might be able to prepare enough supplies to leave.

That all ended with the arrival of an AI fleet, which pushed one of the three stellar shrouds into a precisely calculated crash trajectory, hitting the centre of the city with a margin of error of less than 2km and burning 90 per cent of the population to a crisp in 30 seconds. With the loss of the shroud, the more than twofold increase in temperature and radiation killed the remaining 10 per cent of the population, leaving only a sandstorm of radiation-stained particles to ravage the planet's surface all day long.

Even after redevelopment, that missing stellar shroud remains a monument to the tragedy that happened here.",,,,
aEP_FSF_Earth,PLANET,"The jewel and planned capital of the DWR43 system, this heavily modified proto-tundra planet had not yet seen any inhabitants move in before the Collapse occurred, with only a unit of terraforming microbes working on terraforming the local ecology. The transformation process was almost complete when the system received an unexpected visitor - a fleet of automated ships comprised of multiple Alpha Cores.

What happened afterwards is chilling; the AI fleet proceeded to take over the ecological modification system, transforming the planet into an anomalous terrestrial-like planet with a full ecosystem and breeding numerous species adapted to the environment, but in a manner that rendered the planet completely hostile to humans, as only a deliberately edited biological weapon could do. Why those AIs would do something like this that would be completely irrelevant to its given mission; if it truly was a failure of the logic-limiting algorithm onboard those cores, perhaps would be an even more horrific situation.",,,,
aEP_SpaceFactory,CUSTOM,"The former Stellar Energy Extraction Station, which was converted into a military garrison by the FSF Corporation, unfortunately had most of its functions never come online. The vast available interior space houses the company's most secretive department, a testing ground for superior weaponry, with the presence of AI fleets in the galaxy making it the perfect place to conduct combat testing. In order to avoid the loss of personnel by engaging the AI without maintaining absolute superiority, and to avoid exposing their position by exchanging too much material with the outside world, the station requires the maximum possible use of the extraction station's energy and excavation base for energy and material self-sustainability.

That said, it was a rather extravagant expense to make half of the facility an ecosphere, hence making the place feel more of a refuge from the next major collapse than a ship's weapons testing ground.",,越是接近这个造物，越是能感受到它的巨大，这个原来用于给星系中提供几乎无限能量的设施在建造终止前似乎连外壳都没有完全竣工，从一些接合处仍然能看到当代科技的痕迹,,
