"Damn what's going on "
"Damn what the hell is wrong with them, is that an Aurora class, they've been chasing us for days, and you're telling me they're pirates? I don't think pirates have a damn Aurora class, they found us, hiding in the nebula didn't help at all.--Ship Shredder Over."


"Put up the shield, man, whatever it is we're going hard, we haven't run into a situation where we've been whisked away in over a decade since we bought these two cruisers, and I think the ship can hold up for another decade or so.--Lamdor Defender Over."


"Damn it, damn it, it must be those damn Tachyons trying to get our ships for research, if we survive this battle I'm going to the company for a medal and say 'we protected your precious ships from evil tachyon researchers', all systems nominal on my ship, prepare for battle and crush them like we have always been.--Ship Shredder Over."
