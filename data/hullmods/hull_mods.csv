Controlled Shield,aEP_ControledShield,1,FSF设计,,FSF,,20000,,,,5,10,15,25,data.hullmods.aEP_ControledShield,"An enhanced shield control system that captures the trajectory of incoming projectiles from long distances and automatically hardens the shield right before impact.

At zero hard flux, the ship gains an additional {%s} flux dissipation per second for every flux vent installed. However, as hard flux levels increases, this effect is reduced, and eventually reverses to reduce flux dissipation by the same amount when hard flux levels hit 100%%.
 
No bonus is provided when the ship does not have shields or has had them disabled.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_softflux_dissipate.png

FSF Hull Design,aEP_MarkerDissipation,0,FSF设计,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_MarkerDissipation,"FSF hulls feature an internal open flux pipeline which leaves a large number of interfaces to enable aggressive modifications to the ship and reduces the consequences of flux overload. When a ship produces soft flux in a short period of time, it enters a warm-up state, and remaining in the warm-up state provides various bonuses based on installed hullmods. 

When the ship's flux capacity is much greater than its flux dissipation, it is easier for it to maintain its warm-up state.
When the ship's flux dissipation is close to its flux capacity, it is quicker to switch between preheat and non-preheat states.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_marker_dissipation.png
